# Advanced-Tutorial-2022
This repository stores the code, presentations, and material used in the R-HTA in LMICs Advanced 2022 Workshop (held in January 2023). The following sections provide a breakdown of the primary documents and guidance on how to use them for your own personal training. The tutorial is based on several open-source materials, specifically the coding framework for R in HTA developed by the [DARTH](https://darthworkgroup.com) group and the Shiny framework for HTA developed by [Dark Peaks](https://darkpeakanalytics.com).
